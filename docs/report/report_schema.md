# Incident Report Schema

This document defines the required structure and content of an incident
report generated by LogLint AI.

All generated reports MUST follow this schema exactly.

## 1. Executive Summary
- 1–3 bullet points
- Must state whether an incident occurred
- Must reference the peak incident window if one exists

## 2. Incident Window
- Start time (UTC)
- End time (UTC)
- Total requests in window
- 5xx count
- 5xx failure rate

## 3. Impact Overview
- Which user-facing functionality was affected
- Relative severity (low / moderate / high) based on failure rate

## 4. Error Hotspots
- Top failing endpoints (from metrics)
- Relative contribution of each endpoint

## 5. Traffic Context
- Whether traffic volume increased, decreased, or remained stable
- Any notable client behavior (if present in metrics)

## 6. Likely Explanation
- Hypothesis grounded in metrics
- Must use cautious language (“suggests”, “is consistent with”)

## 7. Recommended Next Checks
- 3–5 concrete investigation steps
- No speculative fixes

If a required metric is missing, the report MUST explicitly state that the
information is unavailable.
