# Example Incident Report

This document provides an example of a complete, well-formed incident report
generated by LogLint AI. It illustrates the expected structure, tone, and level
of detail for reports produced by the system.

---

## 1. Executive Summary

- A partial service outage occurred during a short time window.
- Nearly half of all requests failed at the peak of the incident.
- Failures were concentrated on a small set of authentication and checkout endpoints.

---

## 2. Incident Window

- **Start:** 2015-05-20T12:05:00Z  
- **End:** 2015-05-20T12:10:00Z  
- **Total requests:** 114  
- **5xx responses:** 55  
- **5xx failure rate:** 48.2%

This five-minute window represents the period with the highest concentration
of server-side failures observed in the log.

---

## 3. Impact Overview

During the incident window, a significant fraction of incoming requests resulted
in server errors. The observed failure rate indicates a **moderate to high
severity** degradation of service, particularly for endpoints related to user
authentication and checkout workflows.

While the incident was short-lived, the high failure rate suggests that users
attempting affected actions during this period were likely unable to complete
their requests successfully.

---

## 4. Error Hotspots

Server errors were not evenly distributed across endpoints.

The following endpoints contributed most to 5xx responses during the incident:

- `/api/login` — dominant source of failures
- `/api/checkout`
- `/downloads/product_1`

The concentration of failures on a small number of endpoints suggests that the
issue may be localized to a specific backend service or dependency shared by
these routes.

---

## 5. Traffic Context

Overall request volume increased during the incident window compared to
surrounding periods. This increase coincided with the spike in server errors.

A small number of client IPs accounted for a disproportionate share of requests
during the incident window. While this may reflect automated or scripted traffic,
the available data is insufficient to determine intent.

---

## 6. Likely Explanation

The temporal alignment of increased request volume and elevated server error
rates is consistent with a scenario in which backend resources became saturated
or a dependent service degraded under load.

The concentration of failures on authentication and checkout endpoints suggests
that the issue may be related to shared application logic or an external
dependency used by these services.

This interpretation is based solely on observed log behavior and should be
validated against application-level telemetry and deployment history.
